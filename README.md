# Distributed Cloud Load Testing Platform (Backend)

A cloud-native distributed load testing backend platform designed to orchestrate automated performance testing through microservices architecture and API-driven execution.

---

## 🔧 Self-developed Load Testing Execution Engine

Decoupled and refactored JMeter’s core execution logic and integrated it into backend services, building an API-driven load testing engine capable of automated and concurrent test execution.

---

## 🏗️ Microservices Architecture Design

Implemented a microservices architecture using:

- **Nacos** for service discovery and configuration management  
- **OpenFeign** for inter-service communication  

This design improves service decoupling, modular deployment, and system scalability.

---

## 📦 Test Artifact Storage Solution

Designed an object storage system using **MinIO** to manage performance test artifacts such as reports, logs, and execution outputs, enabling centralized storage and efficient retrieval.

---

## 🧪 QA-driven Platform Design *(In progress)*

Leveraging hands-on QA experience, the platform is designed beyond traditional HTTP interface load testing.

Integration with **Selenium** is currently in progress to support UI automation testing and expand end-to-end testing capabilities.

---

## 🧠 Advanced Assertion Mechanism *(Planned)*

Designing a dynamic response validation module based on **regular expressions** to enable automated verification of complex API responses and improve testing reliability.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization System *(Planned)*

Planning to integrate **Sa-Token** to implement lightweight distributed authentication and RBAC-based authorization, ensuring secure access control and tenant-level isolation.
