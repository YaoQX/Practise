Online Test Systems(Backend)

Self-developed Load Testing Engine Core

Decoupled and refactored the core execution logic of JMeter and integrated it into backend services, building an elastic load testing engine controllable via APIs.

Scalable Microservices Architecture

Adopted a microservices architecture using Nacos for service discovery and configuration management.
Implemented efficient inter-service communication through OpenFeign, ensuring high availability and scalability of the system.

Large-scale Data Storage Solution

Designed an object storage solution using MinIO to handle large-volume performance test reports and artifacts, supporting distributed storage and efficient retrieval.

QA-Driven Architecture Design (Planned)

Leveraging hands-on QA experience, the platform is designed beyond traditional HTTP load testing.
Planned integration with Selenium to support UI automation testing, aiming to build a comprehensive end-to-end quality assurance platform.

Advanced Assertion Mechanism (Planned)

Designing a dynamic response validation module based on regular expressions, enabling automated verification of complex business logic responses and improving test accuracy.

Unified Authentication & Security (Planned)

Planning to integrate Sa-Token to implement lightweight distributed authentication and RBAC authorization, ensuring tenant isolation and system security in multi-tenant environments.
